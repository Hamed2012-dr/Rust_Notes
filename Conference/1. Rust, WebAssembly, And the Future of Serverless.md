## Rust

- **Rust** is blazingly fast, secure and safe.
- **Rust** is a runtime language.

## WebAssembly

- Assume **Unreal Engine** in the web browser.
- **WebAssembly** have binary format and it have a small size compared with **JavaScript**. So it's blazingly fast.
- You dont have to write **WebAssembly** with your hand.
- **WebAssembly** is a cool part of future. **Rust** is the best-in-class tooling for building **WebAssembly** stuff. So learn **Rust** near **JavaScript**.
